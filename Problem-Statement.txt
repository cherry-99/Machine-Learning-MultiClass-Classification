Explore the e cacy of machine learning (ML) in characterizing exoplanets into different classes. The source of
the data used in this work is University of Puerto Rico's Planetary Habitability Laboratory's Exoplanets Catalog
(PHL-EC). Perform a detailed analysis of the structure of the data and propose methods that can be used to
effectively categorize new exoplanet samples. Contributions are two-fold; elaborate on the results obtained
by using ML algorithms by stating the accuracy of each method used and propose a paradigm to automate the task
of exoplanet classification for relevant outcomes.
